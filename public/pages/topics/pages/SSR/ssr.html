                    At a simple [ Google: "SSR" ] search on my computer we get a list of the following websites in this particular order:
                    <ol>
                        <li><a href="https://kruschecompany.com">https://kruschecompany.com</a></li>

                    </ol>
                    One of the key components that makes possible this ranking is SSR (Server-side rendering). And that is because the web is indexed 
                    and has a list of the most "voted" sites based on many factors (e.g. mentions of these websites is one way of increasing the ranking, yet readibility is primordial to go up in the ranks.
                    And that is because the way the Internet is made to work. It reads the HTML but it leaves the JavaScript for a later time which for some migh capitalize more.

                <p>
                    A website built following this technique has something to present that is understandable to a human or a google bot 
                    to categorize it without further needed processing, making it ready for ranking and other benefits that come with that 
                    ahead of more dynamic webpages that rely on javascript to start rendering anything to the user.

                    Most sources on the Internet agree on the following definition:
                    "Server-side rendering (SSR) is a method of loading your website’s JavaScript on your own server.
                     When human users or search engine web crawlers like Googlebot request a page, the content reads as a static HTML page."

<!--SSR ALTERNATIVES----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div id="ssralternatives" class="row">

            <div class="media-body">

                    Client-Side Rendering (CSR) is the increasingly popular alternative to SSR.
                <p>
                <p>
                    The difference between the two is similar to ordering a prepared meal kit from a service like Blue Apron or Green Chef, or buying all the ingredients and making the meal yourself. 
                    Client-side rendering loads a website’s JavaScript in the user’s browser, not the website’s server. It’s ordering the prepared meal kit. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Websites built with front-end JavaScript frameworks such as Angular, React or Vue all default to CSR. This is problematic from an SEO standpoint because when web crawlers encounter a page on your website, all they see is a blank screen. 
                    SSR pages have much faster load time and a much faster first contentful paint, because the content is available in the browser sooner. That means less time your user has to look at a loading screen. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is resource-heavy and code-intensive. Downloading it onto a browser using CSR contributes significantly to page weight. A single JavaScript file averages out to about 1MB, whereas web development best practice advises keeping the entire page under 5MB max. 
                    The performance enhancements that come with SSR also have their own SEO benefits. Google gives preferential search rankings to the sites with the fastest page load speed. Faster load times improve user metrics such as session duration and bounce rate; Google algorithms look at these metrics and give you an extra SEO bost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If SSR is so much more technically well-optimized and SEO-friendly, why don’t all websites use it?
                    Turns out, using SSR for your website does come with some significant drawbacks. It’s expensive, difficult to implement and requires a lot of manpower to set up. 
                    It also puts the burden of rendering your JavaScript content on your own servers, which will rack up your server maintenance costs.
